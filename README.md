# Submarine_Game

This is a simple game I wrote when learning to program with Python.  
I utilized some simple images and sound files I found out on the web to build this 80's arcade-like game.  
Although I built this to run on Linux, I have successfully run it on Windows(R) as well.
In order to run this game, the "pygame" module must be installed.
The programs runs under version three of Python.  Depending upon the version or versions of Python
installed on your PC, the command to run this program might be "python Submarine.py" or "python3 Submarine.py"
Enjoy!
